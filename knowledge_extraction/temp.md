### Countermeasures for Threat Scenarios:

1. **Denial of Service (DoS) attack on Kafka Streaming Cluster:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Implement rate limiting and access control lists to limit the number of requests and prevent overload.
   - **Implementation:** Configure Kafka for proper resource management, set up monitoring for abnormal behavior, and have a failover mechanism in place.

2. **Exploitation of misconfigured access controls on Data Lake (Cassandra):**
   - **Countermeasure:** Enforce strict access controls and regularly audit permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Implementation:** Utilize role-based access control (RBAC), implement encryption at rest, and conduct regular security assessments.

3. **Interception of data transmission between Spark Streaming and Cassandra:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Implement end-to-end encryption and message authentication to ensure data integrity.
   - **Implementation:** Use secure communication protocols like TLS/SSL, validate input data, and monitor for unusual data patterns.

4. **SQL Injection on REST API and Web Component:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Implement input validation, parameterized queries, and least privilege access to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - **Implementation:** Use web application firewalls (WAFs), conduct code reviews for vulnerabilities, and sanitize user inputs.

5. **Leakage of financial data through bypassing authentication controls on Direct Data Push to App:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms, implement data encryption, and monitor access logs for suspicious activities.
   - **Implementation:** Utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA), encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest, and set up real-time alerts for unauthorized access.

6. **Infection of Hadoop HDFS with malware:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Implement regular malware scans, access controls, and data backups to mitigate the impact of malware infections.
   - **Implementation:** Use antivirus software, restrict access to critical systems, and maintain offline backups for data recovery.

7. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on data transmission between Spark Batch Processing and Hadoop HDFS:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Utilize secure communication channels, digital signatures, and certificate pinning to prevent MitM attacks.
   - **Implementation:** Implement mutual TLS authentication, use secure VPNs for data transfer, and regularly update SSL certificates.

8. **Abuse of privileges on Spark Streaming to tamper with data processing:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Implement role-based access control, audit trails, and anomaly detection to detect and prevent unauthorized activities.
   - **Implementation:** Enforce least privilege principles, monitor user activities, and conduct regular security training for staff.

9. **Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Data Sources APIs to inject malicious data:**
   - **Countermeasure:** Implement input validation, API security best practices, and regular security patches to prevent API vulnerabilities.
   - **Implementation:** Use API gateways for filtering and validation, conduct security assessments of APIs, and monitor for API abuse.
